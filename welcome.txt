# Welcome to spotify-tui

Created by moonlight58  
GitHub: https://github.com/moonlight58

Inspired by [Rigellute's spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/tree/master) - check out their amazing work!

This project is written in C from scratch.  
It uses the ncurses library for the Text User Interface and Spotifyâ€™s Web API for all requests.

**Note:**  
Unfortunately to play songs, you need a Spotify Premium account.  
See: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/start-a-users-playback  
"This API only works for users who have Spotify Premium."
